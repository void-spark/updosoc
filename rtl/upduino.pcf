# Normal GPIO pins, left side
set_io clk 35 # 12Mhz crystal: Make sure to wire PIN 35 to PIN J6 for this.

# Normal GPIO pins, right side
set_io ser_tx 45 # Chip TX: Connect PIN 45 to external uart RX for this
set_io ser_rx 46 # Chip RX: Connect PIN 46 to external uart TX for this
set_io reset_button 4 # Chip reset line: Connect PIN 4 to a button for this, high = reset.

# The LED pins are using the current controlled outputs
# and are negative logic (write a 0 to turn on).
set_io led_r    41 # On board RED Led
set_io led_g    39 # On board GREEN Led
set_io led_b    40 # On board BLUE Led
